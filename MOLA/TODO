* migrate all todos to GitLab
* another modif

* recondition input of PRE.addSurfacicExtractions

* CO.extractArrays -> use IntegralScales (FluxCoeff, TorqueCoeff ?) dependent
  on field names ?

* use computeGeneralLoadsOfLiftingLine in bodyforce context

* allow user to define PhaseDirection in bodyforce context

* EXTRACTIONS
  Include extractions for:
   -> slices (from existing variables, including distance to wall!)
   -> basic shapes (sphere, cube, cylinder)


* Preprocess and eventually Coprocess:
  add :

  I._adaptZoneNamesForSlash(t)
  I._correctPyTree(t, level=10) # force CGNS names
  I._correctPyTree(t, level=2) # force unique name
  I._correctPyTree(t, level=7) # create familyNames

  in order to mimick corrections done when writing + reading a tree


* investigate iteration number tagging of MemoryUsageOfProc

* PREPROCESS
  -> Include computation of distance to wall
  -> include restart O(2)
  -> include special location of BC capabilities
