Useful commands for configuring MOLA / TreeLab in windows and VSCode integrated 
terminal (you will need Anaconda distribution):

1 - append following directories to your user's PATH and PYTHONPATH environment
variables:

PATH:
C:\Anaconda3\Scripts

PYTHONPATH:
\\navier\lbernard\stck\MOLA\Dev


1 - edit your profile .ps1, e.g:
D:\lbernard\Documents\WindowsPowerShell\Microsoft.PowerShell_profile.ps1
with following contents:

echo 'profile is in' $profile
function treelab()
{
  python -c "import MOLA.GUIs.TreeLab as g;g.launch('$args')"
}

2 - You need to activate unrestricted script permissions for your user.
In a standard WindowsPowerShell terminal enter:

> Set-ExecutionPolicy -Scope "CurrentUser" -ExecutionPolicy "Unrestricted"

3 - open vscode and open a powershell integrated terminal.
You may have an error when command 'conda activate base' is prompted.
Then, introduce command:

> conda init

and open new terminal.
